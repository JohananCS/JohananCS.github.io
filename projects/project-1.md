For me, music is a big passion of mine. As a pianist who mainly studies in the realm of jazz and such music, hip hop had only been something I would listen to occasionally. I have already had some mild experience in producing music, but at the time I felt like trying something new. After talking with my friends who would write and make hip hop music for fun, I thought it would be a perfect medium especially since I had already started on something. This project was far from professionally made, as I would work on garage band on my phone during free time in my classes. However, for the first official beat I've made, I was quite satisfied with how it turned out.

Since then this project has got me thinking about the potential I could have if I spent even more time and resources on making music, the possibilities of things I could make. While this may have no relevance to the computer science world, it definitely has creative values and the idea of working at something to improve a skill, especially technological proficiency as well as working collaboratively. This is one of a few small music projects I've worked on.
