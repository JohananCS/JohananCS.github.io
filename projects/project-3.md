Within the start of my second year as a Computer Science student, I took the 212 course which was heavy on coding in terminal as we used C and C++, during this time we worked on and completed multiple challenging tasks including a banking module. This was probably one of the hardest coding projects I have ever done, which I still think I could imrpove if I went back to it. This project had many steps, where we would have to make a user interface for someone to have multiple options such as opening, searching for, etc. different bank accounts as well as store a name and address inside of the accounts. This was also the first time I utilized allocating memory and learning how to free it afterwards. This definitely stretched me as a programmer and taught me a lot.
