I developed a Bank Account Management system in UNIX using C++, incorporating advanced programming techniques such as linked lists, dynamic arrays, and efficient memory allocation strategies. The system featured a looping interface that allowed for seamless navigation and rapid execution of operations, ensuring an intuitive and responsive user experience. By leveraging linked lists, the program dynamically handled account data, enabling easy addition, removal, and modification of records without excessive memory usage. Dynamic arrays were utilized for efficient storage and retrieval, while careful memory management minimized resource overhead. This project not only demonstrated the versatility of C++ in creating robust and scalable applications but also showcased my ability to implement complex data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.There we a lot of steps where we would have to make a user interface for someone to have multiple options such as opening, searching for, etc. different bank accounts as well as store a name and address inside of the accounts. This was also the first time I utilized allocating memory and learning how to free it afterwards. This definitely stretched me as a programmer and taught me a lot.

Check out my project, make sure to compile together, you can use one of the make files [Bank Project.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18557112/Bank.Project.zip)
