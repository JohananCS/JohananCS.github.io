<h2> Standards in coding? </h2>
  When it comes to solo or collaborative work, especially in coding, standards are always a top priority to keep your work uniform and efficient. While spontaneity and non-homogenized work is encouraged in more creative fields such as music or art, it is something enforced for the best interest in software engineering. For example, if you are builind a house, or a wall even, you want all your bricks to fit the same scheme, compisition, and mold so that what ever you build is structurally sound, visually pleasing, and

<h2> An upgrade to IntelliJ </h2>

Anyways, thanks to my priviledges as a student, I am able to utilize Jet Brain's very own Intellij IDE. This IDE has proven to be very user friendly with easy to access settings and management.

Using this has honestly been a hassle that I do not like, I feel like it constricts my coding and feels like I am being watched by a nitpicky grader. However, there is a reason for it being part of my practices so that is teaches me to have practical skills when I may work in a field where standards are the only thing unifying multiple collaborators.
