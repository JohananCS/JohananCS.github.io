<h1>A Radical Way to Graduate</h1>
<h2>It’s Rad</h2>

<p>Recently I have reviewed and used the Radgrad resource and I have gained a lot out of it.
While it was something I briefly skimmed over at first, it was something I came back to in order to gain valuable information about courses and opportunities in my career path of software engineering. RadGrad is a wonderful tool that I would not have otherwise known about. After completing the tutorial on the website, I have a lot to say as to what I like about it and what I've learned from it.

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>
In addition to its assistant and resource provision for students, RadGrad also has strong pillars in what they stand for and what they believe. They are founded on three concepts: engagement, retention, and diversity. Their goal is explained as:

  <blockquote>
    The fundamental goal of the RadGrad Project is to provide students, faculty, and advisors with an alternative perspective on the undergraduate degree program---which traditionally boils down to a single kind of activity (coursework) and a single metric for success (grade point average).
  </blockquote>

<p>
This not only makes me as a user and student cared about but also supported by a community and team in my endeavors and goals.

<h2>Take away</h2>

<p>
I learned a lot from even the tutorial of RadGrad alone. Using the many features and exploring on my own revealed that there is a lot more to my degree than just passing classes. I can now plan my classes that I want/need to take in more depth and also have more information about opportunities that I want to be a part of. I think that this definitely would help me have a better degree experience where I am able to be in control, be involved, and be committed. I would recommend anyone in STEM to take a look at RadGrad because I’m sure that even if they don’t end up using it a lot, they can still get something out of it
</p>

<h2>Overall thoughts</h2>
<p>As mentioned, I think RadGrad is an amazing source and I will definitely be referring back to it as I progress further into my college career. I definitely want to become part of some of the opportunities and events as well as informing myself further on what I want to specialize in and what course I will benefit the most from. I think RadGrad has motivated me and inspired me to lock in on my path as a computer scientist and software engineer. </p>
