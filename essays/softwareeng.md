A Career as a Software Engineer

When I began thinking about what I wanted to do in college I  already knew that I would want to get into software engineering. even from a young age, I had a natural affinity towards computers and Technology. my dad would have me practice on a computer with no operating system so I would have to navigate it with commands. Even in high school, I was able to learn quickly in my computer science classes. That being said, I still faced challenges and times when I felt like I couldn't do it.  However, when I was able to overcome these challenges it pushed me even further and encouraged me that I could succeed in this field.

I would say that one of the biggest reasons that I consider this field is because of its versatility in today's world. As we know we are in a very technology-based world and almost any company has a computer system behind it. if I am able to become proficient enough in computer science I could be a valuable asset and therefore have many opportunities and options in the field of employers and job opportunities. 

I am almost halfway done with my degree and it has not been easy. my major-specific courses have really tested me and pushed me in my ability and in my understanding. I still question my passion every day, but I think part of it Is pushing past the difficulty and logging in on my goals. It is not much of a goal if it is easily achieved. As I may be overwhelmed I'm still looking forward to my future in software engineering.
