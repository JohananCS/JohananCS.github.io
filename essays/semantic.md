<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

<p>
  Over the past couple weeks, I have delved into the realm of HTML, webd esign, styling with CSS, and more. Through the various exercises and practices that I have done, I have learned quite a bit even in a shorter period of time. HTML on paper is something that appears to be very basic, but the more I used it, and especially with the introduction of CSS styling I realized that it has the potential to be quite an intricate language and application. Compared to other languages I have used such as JavaScript or C++, HTML has a much different approach and in my opinion, is much easier to visualize the output because of its canvas-like application. I think that in terms of developing web pages and whatnot, HTML is appropriately probably the most optimized to do so.

<h2>Semantic UI Framework</h2>

<p>
	On top of the aforementioned potential of HTML, we have recently welcomed the Semantic UI onboard as well as all of its amazing features. Despite being able to implement everything from scratch using HTML + CSS, Semantic UI makes life a bit easier (and cleaner). It gives very convenient and minimalistic cookie cutters for your various webpage needs. The beauty of it is that all of their features and templates are archived quite accessibly at their <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/">website</a>. Semantic UI definitely has a learning curve because it modifies what you might already know about HTML. However, for practicality, learning it will probably make your life easier.

<h2>For Example</h2>

<p>
  Below, I have attached an example in one of the exercises I have done that utilizes HTML+CSS and Semantic UI.
To summarize the key features, there is a nav bar at the top with icons and a drop-down menu. There is a centered logo, as well as a main section menu. A large image (what would have been a video) that fills the majority of the page, and finally there is a footer section with a distinguished color with more items and even a user input section. While this is not anything crazy, it has revealed to me how much there really is to it.

<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>
  Overall I can say that as of recently, I have been having fun with what we are learning. HTML is definitely something I have taken interest in and something I possibly may consider more seriously in the future. In regards to the addition of using a framework, I definitely have a deeper appreciation for it now since I have learned just how easy it makes formatting and how it can easily make your website look so much neater.
